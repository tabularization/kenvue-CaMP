# About This Project ðŸ’»

This project was completed as part of my portfolio while participating in an 8-week mentorship program with Kenvue.

The Kenvue mentorship is aimed at STEM majors and provides guidance on landing internships, as well as technical workshops to help create portfolios and build successful job applications. Over the 8 weeks, I was able to gain valuable skills for showcasing my abilities to potential employers.

This specific project demonstrates my proficiency in HTML/CSS & Javascript. I chose to develop it as part of my portfolio to highlight my strengths in UI/UX design and Frontend Development.
